# calculator

This is the final project in the “Foundations” path of The Odin Project's curriculum.

I extended the official project to allow changing the colors of the calculator, buttons, background, etc., and added dynamic font resizing on the calculator screen when approaching to full screen fill.

What could be improved/added in the future? 

* The thought is that it is worthwhile for the calculator to display the correct values of the calculations. Currently, for example, performing a multiplication of 1.3 * 3 we get the result 3.9000000000000004. This is due to the representation of floating point numbers in JavaScript (as well as in other programming languages). From what I have read this can be prevented by using libraries for precision arithmetic such as Big.js. 

* In case of an error, instead of displaying a boring message with the wording “ERROR”, you can add something more fun, such as lenny face.

I have a feeling that my code is very hmm chaotic, imprecise and there is a lot of potential improvement, but I hope that with time it will just become better and more coherent.

If anyone has read this, I wish you all the best and don't give up on the road to becoming a better programmer :)
